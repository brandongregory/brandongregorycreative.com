    <h1>Design</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I made my first website in 1995, using the school&rsquo;s version of Photoshop, back when the only code a designer needed to know was HTML. I&rsquo;ve been working in the Web industry since 1999 (starting as a student employee for my college), and I did the agency thing from 2006-2017. I spent five years as a design manager at a fast-paced agency in Kansas City, spending a lot of time designing myself, and the average conversion rate of our sites rose over 50% under my leadership.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m a big believer that design is a tool used to solve a business problem within a set of parameters. If you need more leads, that&rsquo;s a design problem; if you need to improve your company image, that&rsquo;s a design problem too. I&rsquo;ve never met a client that wanted to pay people to express themselves—clients have problems and designers can solve them.</p>
    <p>In addition to web, I&rsquo;m also big on collaboration. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/defeating-workplace-drama-with-emotional-intelligence">written</a> <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/managing-ego">articles</a> on how we can better understand each other, and, with experience in design, writing, front end, back end, and management, I quickly put together how we should be working together.</p>
    <h2>Who I’ve Worked With</h2>
    <p><span class="caps">PlattForm (now Thruline Marketing)</span> / 2006-2014, designed websites for schools, including numerous conversion-oriented landing pages</p>
    <p><span class="caps">Intouch Solutions</span> / 2014-2018, consulted with design department on technical capabilities and usability, designed some internal tools</p>
    <p><span class="caps">Blue Rivet</span> / 2018, did some design work for the company’s corporate site</p>
    <p><span class="caps">NIC, Inc.</span> / 2019-current, primary UX Designer on a web application used to build solutions for governmental agencies</p>
    <h2>Creative Philosophy</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Define success as a metric</h3>
    <p>Before any creative decisions are made, you need to know what success means for a project, and it needs to be measurable. If you want more email sign-ups, that's a much different goal than if you want to increase user engagement with your content.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Use data to inform creative decisions</h3>
    <p>Once you know what you&rsquo;re going to be measuring, every creative decision should be geared toward improving that number, and preferably backed up with data. There&rsquo;s data out there on what converts and what doesn&rsquo;t. If you don&rsquo;t have data, do some A/B testing and get some.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Measure, measure, measure</h3>
    <p>Once a project launches, that&rsquo;s when the real work begins. You now have a baseline&mdash;a score for your site. That number needs to get better every six months. Measure the success of every new change, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to test new things to see if they help further your goal.</p>
