            <h1>Brandon does web development.</h1>
            <p>I&rsquo;m a Kansas City developer with 12 years of professional experience, currently working for Blue Rivet as Lead Interactive Architect. I love clean code, and I try to keep solutions as simple as possible without sacrificing anything else.</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;m a natural problem-solver, I can easily break down technical concepts for non-technical people, and I can code just about anything on the front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), as well as some back-end code (PHP, ASP.NET).</p>
            <p>As a team lead, I focus on managing projects, resolving interpersonal problems, and mentoring employees. I still get my hands dirty with code and standards (I am a former technical architect), but I spend most of my time managing.</p>
            <p>Code snippets can be found on my <a href="https://codepen.io/pulpexploder/">CodePen profile</a>.</p>

            <h2>Other Skills</h2>
        	<h4>Do You Design?</h4>
		    <p>Yes, although it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve done anything professionally (besides this site). My fort&eacute; is development, and most of my professional designs belong to my previous employer, so I&rsquo;m choosing not to highlight this, although I got my start in design and my skills are still sharp.</p>
        	<h4>Any Leadership Skills?</h4>
            <p>I was a design manager for five years and a technical architect for two, and I&rsquo;m now a manager again. I have a knack for mentoring and training others, and I&rsquo;m a natural problem-solver, which works well in a leadership position.</p>
