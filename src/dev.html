    <h1>Development</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I’m a Kansas City-based web developer who’s been working full-time in the industry since 2006. My forte is front-end development, although I’ve done some back-end work as well. I love clean code, and I try to keep solutions as simple as possible without sacrificing anything.</p>
    <p>I have experience as an individual contributor, a manager, and a technical leader, so I’ve really done development from all sides. I’m currently working as a Senior UX/UI Developer focusing on web applications.</p>
