    <h1>Writing</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I’ve been a writer longer than I’ve been a designer/developer, and it’s something I hope I’ll be doing until the day I die. I write articles on everything from JavaScript to professional skills to mental health to movies, and you’ll find my articles in numerous online publications.</p>
    <p>In addition to writing various places, I’m also an editor at <a href="https://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a>, and I have a few little side projects that I run as well, detailed below.</p>
    <h2>Published Articles</h2>
    <p>These are big publications that have featured my writing.</p>
