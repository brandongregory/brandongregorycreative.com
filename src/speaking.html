            <h1>Brandon speaks.</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Brandon, and I&rsquo;m a Creative. By Creative, I mean I am creative, and I like to create things. I&rsquo;m a web developer, writer, and musician living in the Kansas City area. I can usually be found tinkering around with one of my artforms, either trying to get better or trying to create something.</p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re also a Creative (or a Techie!), I&rsquo;d love to meet you. Shoot me an email or say hi next time you see me, because I love meeting new people. Also feel free to reach out over social media (although I&rsquo;ll warn you right now, I&rsquo;m not very good with the Twitter).</p>
            <p>Other things I&rsquo;m into include coffee, cats, and conquering others in board games or video games.</p>
