            <h1>Want to know about Brandon?</h1>
            <p>I made my first website in 1995, back when all a developer needed to know was HTML. I&rsquo;ve been working in the Web industry since 1999 (starting as a student employee for my college), and I&rsquo;ve been doing the agency thing since 2006. I&rsquo;m currently working for <a href="http://intouchsol.com">Intouch Solutions</a> in the Kansas City area as a development team lead. I manage workflow, supervise a small team, and maintain a few direct client relationships.</p>
            <p>In addition to web technologies, I&rsquo;m also big on collaboration. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/defeating-workplace-drama-with-emotional-intelligence">written</a> <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/managing-ego">articles</a> on how we can better understand each other, and, with experience in design, writing, front end, back end, and management, I quickly put together how we should be working together.</p>

            <h2>Creative Philosophy</h2>
            <h3 class="h4">Step 1: Define success as a metric</h3>
            <p>Before any creative decisions are made, you need to know what success means for a project, and it needs to be measurable. If you want more email sign-ups, that's a much different goal than if you want to increase user engagement with your content.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Step 2: Use data to inform creative decisions</h3>
            <p>Once you know what you&rsquo;re going to be measuring, every creative decision should be geared toward improving that number, and preferably backed up with data. There&rsquo;s data out there on what converts and what doesn&rsquo;t. If you don&rsquo;t have data, do some A/B testing and get some.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Step 3: Measure, measure, measure</h3>
            <p>Once a project launches, that&rsquo;s when the real work begins. You now have a baseline&mdash;a score for your site. That number needs to get better every six months. Measure the success of every new change, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to test new things to see if they help further your goal.</p>
