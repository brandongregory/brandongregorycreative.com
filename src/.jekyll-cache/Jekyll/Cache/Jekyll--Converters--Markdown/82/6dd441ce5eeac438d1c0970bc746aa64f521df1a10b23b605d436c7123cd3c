I"ï<p>Have you ever landed a site, looking for the answer to a burning question, only to have the screen darken and a pop-up appear, covering the content you want to read and asking you to give them your personal information so they can send you updates? Theyâ€™re everywhere, so Iâ€™m going to assume you have. How many of you just love those pop-ups? How many of you say, â€œOh man! I was just wondering how I could stay up-to-date with this website I only discovered three seconds ago!â€?</p>
