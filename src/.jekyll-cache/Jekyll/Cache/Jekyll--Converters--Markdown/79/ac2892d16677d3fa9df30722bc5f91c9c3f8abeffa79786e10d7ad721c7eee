I"®<p>Soooo, I won a joke contest. Chris Coyier of CSS Tricks put out a request for original jokes relating to development, and <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/2018/04/06/developer-joke-winners/">Iâ€™m one of the winners</a>. Hereâ€™s the winning joke:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A designer, a copywriter, and a developer were having a few drinks after work one night. The designer mused, â€œWith such beauty in the world, God must be a designer.â€</p>

  <p>The copywriter scoffed and said, â€œNo, no. The story of mankind is the greatest story ever told. God is clearly a writer.â€</p>

  <p>The developer chuckled quietly and said, â€œCome on, guys. Godâ€™s a developer. Nothingâ€™s documented, something breaks every time we meddle with his work, and his last commit was 2,000 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For my cleverness, I won two t-shirts: a Codepen T-shirt in gray and a Treehouse T-shirt in green. Not a bad haul!</p>
