I"9<p>This site is my first experiment with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a templating language that compiles to static HTML. Why? The technology intrigued me for one reason: speed. Any compiled page is going to be faster than a non-compiled language like PHP (what my previous site was built in).</p>
