    <h1>Brandon Gregory: Creative Professional</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Brandon. I like to create, whether that’s design, writing, music, or something else entirely, and I’m always working on one thing or another. I’m a Senior UX Designer/UI Developer at a medium-sized company in the Kansas City area, and have been tinkering with websites since 1995—and been getting paid for it since 2006!</p>
    <p>I love meeting new people, especially others who do some of the same things I do. Feel free to email, reach out over social media, or just say hi next time you see me.</p>
    <h2>Questions with Answers</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Do you do speaking engagements?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, I do. Email me if you’re interested.</dd>
      <dt>Could I sit down with you sometime and ask you about what you do?</dt>
      <dd>Yeah, absolutely! I love chatting with others in the fields I’m in. Email me and we’ll see about setting something up.</dd>
      <dt>Why is your website in static HTML?</dt>
      <dd>It’s in <em>compiled</em> HTML. I used Jekyll, which uses a templating language and allows for page templates and variables, just like PHP. <a href="blog/tools/jekyll-for-speed.html">You can read about it here.</a></dd>
