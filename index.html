                    <h1>Brandon is creative.</h1>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Brandon, and I&rsquo;m a Creative. By Creative, I mean I am creative, and I like to create things. I&rsquo;m a web developer, designer, and writer living in the Kansas City area. I can usually be found tinkering around with one of my artforms, either trying to improve or trying to create something.</p>
                    <p>If you&rsquo;re also a Creative (or a Techie!), I&rsquo;d love to meet you. Shoot me an email or say hi next time you see me, because I love meeting new people. Also feel free to reach out over social media.</p>
