            <h1>Brandon is creative.</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Brandon, and I&rsquo;m a Creative. By Creative, I mean I am creative, and I like to create things. I&rsquo;m a web developer, designer, and writer living in the Kansas City area. I can usually be found tinkering around with one of my artforms, either trying to improve or trying to create something.</p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re also a Creative (or a Techie!), I&rsquo;d love to meet you. Shoot me an email or say hi next time you see me, because I love meeting new people. Also feel free to reach out over social media.</p>

            <h2>Questions with answers&hellip;</h2>
            <h3 class="h4">Can I hire you for something?</h3>
            <p>If it&rsquo;s full-time, the answer is no. If it&rsquo;s short-term, part-time, feel free to reach out.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Do you do speaking engagements?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I do. <a href="mailto:brandon.gregory.1981@gmail.com">Email me</a> if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Could I sit down with you sometime and ask you about what you do?</h3>
            <p>Yeah, absolutely! I love chatting with others in the fields I&rsquo;m in. Email me and we&rsquo;ll see about setting something up.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Why is your website in static HTML?</h3>
            <p>It&rsquo;s in <em>compiled</em> HTML. I used Jekyll, which uses a templating language and allows for page templates and variables, just like PHP. <a href="/blog/tools/jekyll-for-speed.html">You can read about it here.</a></a></p>
